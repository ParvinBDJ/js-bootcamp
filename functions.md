# Functions

_Now we are going to talk about functions and what i have learned in het Javascript Bootcamp._

Functions are one of the most important thing in Javascript. They can be used to perform a set of statements or calculate
a sum. But before they do so you have to call the function so it knows when to perform its statements. A normal functions looks like this:

```js
function hallo(){           (Here you make the function)
console.log("Hello World");
}

console.log(hallo);         (Here you call the function)
// "Hello World"            (Here is the result which comes in the console)
```

During the bootcamp i went over the basics of functions and i  went deeper into functions. Its there i found out about 
higher-order functions. Higher-order functions are functions within a function. So you can call it a higher-order functions
when a functions accepts or returns a function. This was something which wasn't easy but after a while i got to understand
it better (which doesn't mean that i am 100% comfortable with them after the bootcamp). 

Common higher-order functions like: map, reduce & filter are the most used higher-order functions because by it as a higher-
order functions you don't have to write a loop. An example of such a functions is found below:

```js

const doorDeHelft= [10, 20, 30, 40];
const som = doorDeHelft.map(function(isDoorDeHelft){
return isDoorDeHelft / 2;
}

console.log(isDoorDeHelft);
// ["Parvin", "Lola", "Jantje", "Niemand"]
```
