# ECMAscript
ECMAscript, also known as ES, is the standerd where Javascript works on. There are other languages where Javascript can
run on like: Actionscript & JScript. But we don't have to worry about these languages because we are only focusing on ES. 

When we look at ES you will notice that there are a lot of different versions like: 
 - ES3
 - ES5
 - ES6
 - ES7
 - ES8

For project tech i will try to learn ES6, while all the experience i have had where with ES5. On first sight there is not a
lot of differnce but if you look deeper there is. The new things are mainly how you (can) write functions and that there is a
new way of writing variables. 

&nbsp;

The new thing where you can write functions differently is mostly about a new way that is called "arrow functions". It's
where you would write a normal function like this:

_function niks(x) { <br>_
_x = x + 1<br>_
_return x;<br>_
_}<br>_

And a arrow function, which is a shorter way of writing a function, like this:

_var niks = (x) => x + 1;_

Even though it is completely the same function, you write them differently. I guess i like the way the arrow functions looks
but even after some practice i am not completely comfortable with the way you write it. I think this will hit me later on during
the course.

The other thing that was new in ES6 is the way you write a variable. In ES5 you could only write a variable like this: var a;.
But in ES6 you got different kind of varaibles. Now there are 3 different types. const, let and var. Each of which does something
a little bit different. But they all make a variable.

The first one we are going to discuss is const. Const is short for constant. Const is the same as a variable only you can't change
the value. It creates a read-only variable which can't be changed.

The second one we are going to discuss is let. When let is given a value that value can be changed in a function (so on the local
scope) but that wont change the value on the global scope. While that will happen if you use
